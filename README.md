# leaf-species-classification
This repo contains files related to my Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree capstone project.

The project is based on a Kaggle leaf classification competition.
The project description, objective, methods used, and final results are contained in the "report.pdf" file.

Implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm in Python is in the KNN-in-Python branch.

A TensorFlow implementation of a Multimodal Convolutional Neural Network (as described on pp 17,18, 21 - 23 of "report.pdf") are in the CNN-using-Tensorflow branch.
